# DeepFake-Defenders
DeepFake Defenders is a deep learning-based tool to detect deepfake images and videos. It uses Xception (TensorFlow) for image detection and a hybrid EfficientViT + ViT model (PyTorch) for videos. Trained on FaceForensics++ and HFFD, it helps identify synthetic media with high accuracy.
